# cypress-veriff-homework
Pre-requisites: node.js

How to run tests:
1) In the project folder > "cypress-veriff-homework" run the script > npm run test:run:and:create:report

Remark: Sometimes generating the report fails (usually when tests are failing), so after running tests, run the script > npm run create:html:report
